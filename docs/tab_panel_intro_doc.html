    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>The data analsis we conducted focuses on the health and performance of 
    athletes in the <em>National Basketball Association</em> (NBA) as of the 2021-2022 
    season. Forming our data set from <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com"
    >basketball-reference.com</a>,we developed visualizations and conclusions from 
    the yearly data on current NBA starting lineups, which consist of 5 players, one
    from each position (PG, SG, SF, PF, and C). Taking into consideration a variety
    of features, our data set included elements such as position, minutes played, and attemped field 
    goals, just to name a few. These factors were then used to investigate the
    performances of players across everal criteria, showcasing the modern professional 
    standard in the NBA.</p>
    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p> Furthermore, real-world implications for our project appeal to those
    wanting to know more about the mental and physical endurance required to play
    professional basketball, a sport that adheres to a code only the greatest players
    in the world can follow. Not only this, but we provide a snapshot into the 
    trends for recent seasons to be compared with other projects down the line.</p>
    <h2>Outline</h2>
    <p>Our analysis resulted in three key visualizations, each of which focuses
    on a unique aspect of modern NBA playstyle and performance. In our first plot,
    we consider how overall team performance (as measured by the number of points scored),
    diminishes over the course of the regular season.Likely due to fatigue, as the intense
    grind of an 82-game season wears down the body of every player. Next, the second page 
    of our project analyzes the average shooting percentages for 2- and 3-pointers, by position,
    as of the most recent season. Gaining insight on the shooting efficiency of the
    best players in the world will allow future iterations of our analysis to compare
    future seasons and trends across positions.<br>
    Finally, our third plot narrows in on the team who suffered the most
    injuries during the 2021-22 season, the <i>Orlando Magic</i>, and notes their
    somewhat underwhelming effective Field Goal (eFG) percentage when player's average
    a high number of minutes per game. In context, this allows us to see how team morale,
    which is often left undocumented, might show up in performance numbers as a result of 
    injuries that plague modern athletics of all domains.</p>
    <p>All in all, this NBA Basketball Analysis aims to serve athletes of all levels
    who are curious to know more on contemporary NBA standards and trends, especially
    as they relate to personal well-being and statistical performance</p>.
